# ralph-run.sh — launch wrapper for the Ralph control layer.
#
# Wraps (never modifies) ralph.sh. Responsibilities:
#   * Mint a fresh RALPH_RUN_ID if one isn't already set, and export it so it
#     propagates down the process tree to every agent session. The SessionEnd
#     cost hook stamps it on each cost.jsonl line, making loop spend
#     attributable and separable from ad-hoc sessions (Block G.3).
#   * Run the unchanged ralph.sh with whatever args you pass through.
#   * On completion, dump the full audit/rundown to rundown/YYYY-MM-DD.txt so the
#     morning artifact exists without you running anything (Block H.4).
#
# Usage: ./ralph-run.sh [--tool claude|amp] [max_iterations]
